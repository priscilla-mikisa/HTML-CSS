    <h1 style=" color: purple; border:10px double">My First Week in AkiraChix</h1>
    <p style=" color: green">My name is Mikisa Priscilla, a student at AkiraChix,CodeHive program and this is a brief note of how my first week on campus was.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" color:purple; border">The Good Occurances</h2>
    <ol>
        <li style=" color: green">We were warmly welcomed by the almuni.</li>
        <li style="color: green">We were given a double meal, one in the evening and the other in the night.</li>
        <li style=" color: green">The almuni carried for us our suitcases and helped us settle in really well and fast.</li>
        <li style=" color: green">We were given enough time to sleep after the long journey.</li>
        <li style=" color : green">We were given an orientation of the entire campus and introduced to the different staff so, communication became really easy.</li>

    </ol>
    <h2 style=" color: purple">The Not-So-Good Things I have Experienced</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style=" color: green">The lessons time table was really produced late so, it became difficult to prepare for the next lesson accordingly.</li>
        <li style=" color: green">The resident building is really big and puzzle-like so, fiding my way back to the rooms became a problem.</li>
        <li style=" color: green">The daily program was really delayed so, keeping time for meals became really hard.</li>
    </ul>
